# Concept
Students should be able to view incoming exams, submitted by students and verified by teachers/TA's, and arrange studytimes based on either availability or suggested timeslots.
Secondary to exam scheduling and class studying should be forum page functionality, allowing students to talk about class topics, request help, share notes, and soforth.

Each student should: 
- Contain attributes that declare their **enrolled courses**, or courses they have a relation to (e.g., Instructor/TA access). This specifies what events they can either **create or join on the calender.**
- **Post on message boards** or forum pages, such as to request help (without a dedicated study session), share notes, or discuss class topics in general.

Events are:
- **Created by students** (to be more proactive), and **affirmed by other students or verified by Instructor/TA**.
- Relate to a **specific course** (e.g., "Exam for CSCI###").
- **Aggregate student availability** based on freetime, allowing better setup and arrangement of study sessions by users.
